Get your Snapchat API access token easily

You will need to create a json file called `snapchat_credentials.json` with your Snapchat API client ID, secret and redirect URL in the same folder as `get_snapchat_access.ipynb`.

```
{
	"client_id":"YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
	"client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
	"redirect_url": "YOUR_REDIRECT_URL"
}
```
To get those credentials, make a request by filling the following form: https://developers.snapchat.com/apply/

Documentation on the Snapchat API can be found here: https://developers.snapchat.com/api/docs/
